# Read Me

This is just a bunch of old Java programs I wrote when I was first learning to program anything. I don't use Java much at the moment so I figured this was a good place to store them for now instead of my compuer. 
  Potentially Useful Things
    *Various sorting algorithm implementations
        # right now they only work for ints but in the future I would like to make them generic
    *Several data structure implementations (Not very practical since java has its own but good for learning)
        #Linked list, queue, stack, min and max heaps
